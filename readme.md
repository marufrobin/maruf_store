## Adding Dependencies
To add dependencies in a Spring Boot project, you can modify the `pom.xml` file if you are using Maven. Hereâ€™s how to add a dependency:

1. Open the `pom.xml` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Locate the `<dependencies>` section. If it doesn't exist, you can create one.
3. Add the desired dependency in the following format:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>group-id</groupId>
    <artifactId>artifact-id</artifactId>
    // Optional: specify the version recommended for the dependency
    <version>version</version>
</dependency>
```

4. Save the `pom.xml` file.
5. If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, it may automatically download the new dependency. Otherwise, you can run the following Maven command in the terminal:

```
mvn clean install
```

This will download the specified dependency and make it available in your project.

## Running the Application
just use idea to run the application or for alternative you can use the terminal:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
---
## Testing the Application
To test the application, you can use the following command in the terminal:
```
mvn test
```
This will run all the tests defined in your project. If you want to run a specific test class, you can use the following command:
```
mvn -Dtest=TestClassName test
```
Replace `TestClassName` with the name of the test class you want to run.

## Use of application.properties

The `application.properties` file is used to configure various settings for your Spring Boot application. You can specify properties such as server port, database connection details, logging levels, and more.
Here are some common properties you might find in `application.properties`:
```properties
# Server port
server.port=8080
# Database connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
# App name 
spring.application.name=myapp
# page size
app.page-size=10
```
You can add or modify properties in this file to customize the behavior of your application. Spring Boot will automatically read these properties and apply them at runtime.

## SpringBoot MVC
Spring Boot follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application into three interconnected components:
- Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- View: Represents the user interface and displays the data to the user.
- Controller: Handles user requests, interacts with the model, and returns the appropriate view.

This separation of concerns makes it easier to manage and scale the application.
## SpringBoot Annotations
Spring Boot provides several annotations to simplify the development process. Here are some commonly used annotations:
- `@SpringBootApplication`: Indicates that this is a Spring Boot application.
- `@RestController`: Combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, indicating that the class is a controller and the return values of its methods should be written directly to the HTTP response body.
- `@RequestMapping`: Maps HTTP requests to specific handler methods in the controller.
- `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`: Shorthand annotations for `@RequestMapping` with specific HTTP methods.
